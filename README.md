# AES-265 Cipher
- Implement Advanced Encryption Standard with 128-bit input, 256-bit key, and 14 rounds in Java.
- Read 32 Hex characters, apply AES algorithm to encrypt the string, and write out the cipher text in Hex notation.
- Decrypting the message by reverse the process.

## Files
primary file name : AES.java

## Getting Started
- Compile file by : javac AES.java
- To encrypte file : java AES e key.txt plaintext.txt
- The output in file plaintext.txt.enc
- To decrypte file : java AES d key.txt plaintext.txt.enc 
- The output in file plaintext.txt.enc.dec
